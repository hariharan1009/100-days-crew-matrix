Water Mixing

Chef is setting up a perfect bath for himself. He has X litres of hot water and Y litres
of cold water.

The initial temperature of water in his bathtub is A degrees. On mixing water, the
temperature of the bathtub changes as following:
Â· The temperature rises by 1 degree on mixing 1 litre of hot water.
. The temperature drops by 1 degree on mixing 1 litre of cold water.

Determine whether he can set the temperature to B degrees for a perfect bath.
