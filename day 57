Pass or Fail

Chef is struggling to pass a certain college course.

The test has a total of N questions, each question carries 3 marks for a correct
answer and -1 for an incorrect answer. Chef is a risk-averse person so he decided
to attempt all the questions. It is known that Chef got X questions correct and the
rest of them incorrect. For Chef to pass the course he must score at least P marks.

Will Chef be able to pass the exam or not?
