SOLUTION:
import java.util.Scanner;

class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args)
	{
        Scanner read = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = read.nextInt();
        for(int i=0; i<t; i++)
        {
            int n = read.nextInt();
        
        System.out.println(n*2);
        }
	}
}
