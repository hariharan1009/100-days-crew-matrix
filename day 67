public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        String[] a={"Sunday", "Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday"};
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=sc.nextInt();
        if(n>=1 &&n<=7){
            System.out.println(a[n-1]);
}
        else{
            System.out.println("Invalid day");
        }
    }
}
