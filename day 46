Chef and his Apps

Chef's phone has a total storage of S MB. Also, Chef has 2 apps already installed on his
phone which occupy X MB and Y MB respectively.

He wants to install another app on his phone whose memory requirement is Z MB. For
this, he might have to delete the apps already installed on his phone. Determine the
minimum number of apps he has to delete from his phone so that he has enough
memory to install the third app.
