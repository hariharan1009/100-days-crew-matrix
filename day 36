 Find Closest Number to Zero
Given an integer array nums of size n, return the number with the value closest to 0 in nums . If
there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.
  Example 1:

Input: nums = [-4,-2,1,4,8]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The distance from -4 to 0 is |-4| = 4.
The distance from -2 to 0 is |-2| = 2.
The distance from 1 to 0 is |1| = 1.
The distance from 4 to 0 is |4| = 4.
The distance from 8 to 0 is |8| = 8.
Thus, the closest number to 0 in the array is 1.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,-1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 and -1 are both the closest numbers to 0, so 1 being


  class Solution {
    public int findClosestNumber(int[] nums) {
        int d=nums[0];
        int[] a=new int[nums.length];
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
          if (Math.abs(nums[i]) < Math.abs(d) || 
               (Math.abs(nums[i]) == Math.abs(d) && nums[i] > d)) {
                d = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return d;
    }
}
