Print numbers from 1 to n without the help of loops. You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes N as parameter and prints number from 1 to N recursively.

Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.

Examples

Input: n = 10
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Input: n = 5
Output: 1 2 3 4 5
