Chef is playing with weights. He has an object weighing W units. He also has three
weights each of X, Y, and Z units respectively. Help him determine whether he can
measure the exact weight of the object with one or more of these weights.

If it is possible to measure the weight of object with one or more of these weights, print
YES, otherwise print NO.
