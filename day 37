Blackjack
Chef is playing a variant of Blackjack, where 3 numbers are drawn and each number
lies between 1 and 10 (with both 1 and 10 inclusive). Chef wins the game when the sum
of these 3 numbers is exactly 21.
Given the first two numbers A and B, that have been drawn by Chef, what should be 3-
rd number that should be drawn by the Chef in order to win the game?
Note that it is possible that Chef cannot win the game, no matter what is the 3-rd
number. In such cases, report -1 as the answer.
