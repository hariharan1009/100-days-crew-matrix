	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
	Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=sc.nextInt();
        while(n-->0){
		int a=sc.nextInt();
		int b=sc.nextInt();
		if(a>b){
		    System.out.println(">");
		}
		else if(a<b){
		    System.out.println("<");
		}
		else{
		    System.out.println("=");
		}
