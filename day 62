Endless Appetizers
Life is a like a box of of mozzarella sticks. You never know what you're gonna get, but you can predict with 100 percent accuracy that it will be a mozzarella stick.
Chef's colleague issued a challenge to Chef: "If you eat more than  X mozzarella sticks, I'll give you 30 rupees for each extra one you eat".
For example, if X=5 and Chef eats 8 sticks, he would receive 90 rupees because he ate 3 extra sticks.
You know that the restaurant serves Y mozzarella sticks per plate.
You also know that Chef received R rupees from his colleague as a result of the challenge.
What's the maximum number of plates of mozzarella sticks that Chef could have ordered?
