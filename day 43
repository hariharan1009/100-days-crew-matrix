It is My Serve

Alice and Bob are playing a game of table tennis where irrespective of the point scored,
every player makes 2 consecutive serves before the service changes. Alice makes the
first serve of the match. Therefore the first 2 serves will be made by Alice, then the next
2 serves will be made by Bob and so on.

Let's consider the following example match for more clarity:

. Alice makes the 1st serve.
. Let us assume, Bob wins this point. (Score is 0 for Alice and 1 for Bob)
. Alice makes the 2nd serve.
. Let us assume, Alice wins this point. (Score is 1 for Alice and 1 for Bob)
. Bob makes the 3Td serve.
. Let us assume, Alice wins this point. (Score is 2 for Alice and 1 for Bob)
. Bob makes the 4th serve.

. Let us assume, Alice wins this point. (Score is 3 for Alice and 1 for Bob)
. Alice makes the 5th serve.

. And the game continues ...

After the score reaches P and Q for Alice and Bob respectively, both the players forgot
whose serve it is. Help them determine whose service it is.
